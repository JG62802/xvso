IN ORDER TO RUN THIS I USED VSC's RUN WITH LIVE SERVER, I HAD PLANS OF CONNECTING THIS TO VITE BUT WAS UNABLE TO, thank you! Hello, Welcome to my first real project! Click anywhere inside the tic tac toe board and start playing now! I made all the assets, music and most of the code myself. I hope you enjoy, It sadly is not everything I wanted to have done but I assume that's how things usually go when they're made in a couple days. Anyways I'll probably continue working on this, essentially I have roguelike effects I wanted the pieces to have and I also wanted their to be 30 instead of 14. I got caught up in trying to learn UI which I am horrible with Cascading currently. Although in terms of UI improvement I did set up every grid square that registers clicks solo so that was really fun for me and I think is where I learned the most apart from making assets. Before this project I had made a total of 3 assets and now I've made 18 and I think I really started to get good at shading. I was proud of my fire "texture" I got going on, it reminded me of minecraft. Anyways yeah, I hope you enjoy it's basically just a tic tac toe 1v1 game for now, eventually there will be effects like move opponents pieces one space away, blow up surrounding pieces, etc. and the thing that'll probably take me the longest and that I tried doing all of saturday, the UI to select one of three random pieces, I want the UI to look like 3 rectangles with the sprite, piece name and description but for some reason when I was trying to do it I just couldn't get it to layer it correctly. Anyways enough yapping, I'll be at work when you guys review this I just wanna end this off with thanks for giving me the motivation to really put my all into coding for something I felt really encouraged to try my best and push out of my comfort zone with some of my features and ideas on this project. Sadly, I did not get as much done as I wanted to but I am still happy I participated!
